    <h1><b><u>Staff Trainer Handbook</u></b></h1>

    <h3><u>Note</u></h3>
    <p>Everything between the " " is script, so you don't copy/type it over. It is for you to say to your trainee.</p>

    <br>


    <h3><u>Training Introduction</u></h3>
    <p>“Hello everyone, and welcome to your official staff training session here at NYRP. My name is [Trainer's Name], and I'll be guiding you through this training."</p>
    <p>"Before we begin, please remain respectful, listen carefully, and do not interrupt unless asked to respond. This session will cover rules, tools, and scenarios."</p>
    <p>"At the end, you will be evaluated to determine if you will become an Official Moderator.”</p>

    <br>

    <h3><u>Staff Role & Expectations</u></h3>
    <p>“As a staff member, your responsibility is to enforce rules, assist players, and maintain fair roleplay."</p>
    <p>"You represent the staff team, so professionalism, respect, and fairness are required at all times."</p>
    <p>"Abuse of commands, favoritism, or unprofessional behavior will result in removal from the team.”</p>
    <p><b>"The Key Expectations are:"</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Enforce rules fairly and consistently."</li>
      <li>"Stay calm and professional."</li>
      <li>"Do not abuse commands."</li>
      <li>"Report issues to higher staff if unsure."</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3><u>Staff Role & Expectations</u></h3>
    <p>“Now, let's go over the commands and tools you'll use as staff. These are powerful, and you must use them responsibly.”</p>
    <p><b>"Some core commands are:"</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>"Kick → For repeated or medium rule-breaking after a warning."</li>
      <li>"Ban → For serious violations such as exploiting, harassment, or repeated offenses."</li>
      <li>"Teleport → For investigations or helping players, never for fun."</li>
      <li>"Server Announcements → Only when necessary, e.g., event notices, emergency messages."</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <h3><u>Scenario Training</u></h3>
    <p>“Now we’ll practice staff situations. I’ll give you a scenario, and you’ll tell me how you would handle it.”</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Scenario 1.</li>
        <ul>Example: "Player crashes into roleplay scenes intentionally."</ul>
        <ul>Correct Action: Warn them → Kick if repeated.</ul>

       <li>Scenario 2.</li>
        <ul>Example: "Player glitches or teleports."</ul>
        <ul>Correct Action: Immediate ban → Collect evidence.</ul>

      <li>Scenario 3.</li>
        <ul>Example: "Player insults others."</ul>
        <ul>Correct Action: Warn → Kick if repeated → Ban if severe.</ul>

      <li>Scenario 4.</li>
        <ul>Example: "Player parks cars across intersections."</ul>
        <ul>Correct Action: Ask them to stop → Kick if ignored.</ul>
        
      <li>Question.</li>
        <ul>"What would you do if a player is accusing staff of abusing commands in public chat?"</ul>
        <ul>Correct Action: I would remain calm, ask the player for proof, and handle the situation privately to maintain professionalism.</ul>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <h3><u>Communication & Professionalism</u></h3>
    <p>“Always stay professional when communicating. Warnings should be polite, short, and clear. Never argue or insult players.”</p>
    <p><b>"Good example:</b></p>
    <ul>
      'Please stop blocking the road. This is your only warning.'”
    </ul>
    <p><b>"Bad example:</b></p>
    <ul>
      'Stop being dumb and move your car!'”
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3><u>Logging & Reports</u></h3>
    <p>“Every punishment must be logged. Always include the player’s username, the rule broken, the action you took, and evidence if available."</p>
    <p>"Logs keep everything transparent and protect you from false accusations.”</p>

    <br>

    <h3><u>Evaluation</u></h3>
    <p>At the end of training, test each trainee with scenario questions. Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“How would you handle a player exploiting?”</li>
      <li>“What do you do if a player disrespects you?”</li>
      <li>“What steps should you take before banning someone?”</li>
    </ul>
    
    <br>
    
    <h3><u>Conclusion</u></h3>
    <p>“That concludes your staff training. To check your score please head over to the training-results channel to find your determined results.”</p>
    <p>"From this point forward, you carry the responsibility of helping run the server fairly and professionally. Thank you for your time today, and welcome to the staff team!”</p>
